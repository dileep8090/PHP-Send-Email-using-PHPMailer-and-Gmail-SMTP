# PHP-Send-Email-using-PHPMailer-and-Gmail-SMTP
When you use the PHP mail() function, you end up sending email directly from your web server rather than your mail server. If you have a mail server through your web host, or even a mail server with a different host, it's usually better to send mail through that instead.  The problem is that the PHP mail() function doesn't provide any built-in way to send mail via SMTP. If you want to open up that functionality, you'll need to install an additional PHP class.
<p>Here are some options that work:</p>
<p>PHPmailer </p>
<p> SwiftMailer</p>
<p> Zend_Mail</p>
<p> XpertMailer</p>
<p> PEAR Mail</p>
